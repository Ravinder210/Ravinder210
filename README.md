# 👋 Hi, I'm Ravinder — Machine Learning & GenAI Engineer | Healthcare Innovator

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a final-year B.Tech student in **Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering at IIT Delhi**, deeply passionate about the intersection of **AI**, **Genomics**, and **Healthcare Transformation**.

My work spans from **GenAI-powered clinical trial matching** to **retrieval-augmented generation systems**, combining state-of-the-art ML research with real-world impact.

---

## 🚀 Current Focus Areas

- 🧠 **Large Language Models (LLMs)**  
  Building task-specific LLM pipelines using tools like **LangChain**, **Ollama**, and **OpenAI API**, tailored for healthcare reasoning and document understanding.

- 📄 **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  
  Designing full-stack **RAG systems** with FastAPI, FAISS, Hugging Face, and Docker to enable private, cost-effective question answering over custom datasets.

- 🧬 **AI for Clinical Trials**  
  Contributing to **TrialGPT** — a novel LLM-based framework for matching patients to clinical trials with >87% accuracy at criterion-level prediction.

- 🧪 **Genomics & Biomedical NLP**  
  Exploring GenAI applications in disease classification, digital twins, and clinical evidence mining.
